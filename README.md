# kompanions
## kompanions Test:


our task is to make an application in which a user should be able to make 3D models (like lego) using cubes of varied sizes and colour.

Key Points for the task (sub-tasks) are:

- Take three cuboids of different shapes. User should be able to change the colour of any of the object at will.

- User should be able to drag-drop any of these cuboids anywhere on the screen, even above(on top of) other objects that have been already instantiated in the scene.

- Instantiated objects should be placed on the screen like they are placed on a grid, the objects should not overlap each other on the same plane but they can be placed above another objects.

- User should be able to delete/destroy the instantiated objects.

- At run time, a 2D image will be displayed on the screen (Reference to create a Lego Object). The task for the player is to make the 3D model using cuboids (blocks) by referring the 2D image displayed.
